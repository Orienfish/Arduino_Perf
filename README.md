# IoTSim
This repo is one of the steps to build an IoT simulator. We intend to simulate power, performance and
reliability of a heterogeneous IoT network. To accomplish this, we need validated models of basic
components. This repo has the following features:

- provide CPU and network models of Arduino and Raspberry Pi (3B)
- share measurements of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth according to on/off/connect/disconnect state,
bandwidth, packet size and data rate
- offer useful scripts on Raspberry Pi to change frequency, get CPU utilization, CPU temperature, etc.
